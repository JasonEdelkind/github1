Gila Monster Annual Home Range Size Analysis

My thesis project focuses on investigating how gila monsters vary their home range on an annual basis as environmental conditions change. 

We compiled telemetry data for Gila Monsters at eight sites throughout the states of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Annual home range utilization distributions were calculated using a weighted autocorrelated kernel density estimator. Annual environmental variables quantifying different aspects of precipitation, temperature, and habitat productivity were extracted and calculated for each individual-year combination from Google Earth Engine and ClimateNA.
